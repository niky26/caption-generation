# caption-generation
● Technology: Deep Learning , Python 
● Platform: Jupyter Notebook
● Generates caption based on the image.
● Developed an Image Caption Generator using a combination of CNN
(InceptionV3) for image feature extraction and LSTM (RNN) for sequential
text generation
● Preprocessed the Flickr8K dataset, including tokenization, padding, and image
feature extraction.
● Implemented and trained a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
● Evaluated caption quality using BLEU Score in Beam Search decoding
method.
